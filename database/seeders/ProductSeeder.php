From wide-aisle warehouses and flow racking to conveyor technology and VNA transfer stations – the FM-X iGo covers the entire spectrum of automated processes with the utmost precision thanks to its innovative pallet positioning system (PPS). Two other impressive features are its compatibility with a wide range of load carriers and its power.</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; max-width: 45em;">The FM-X iGo effortlessly lifts up to 2,300 kg on the cantilever forks to storage heights of up to 10 metres. And the lean design allows for a working aisle width of less than 3 metres. For maximum process safety and reliable pedestrian protection, the FM-X iGo is equipped with a multi-level safety system with state-of- the-art laser scanners and sensors that fulfils all the requirements of the ISO 3691-4 safety standard. Its performance is as sophisticated as its handling is straightforward due to the smart STILL iGo automation solution, such as plug-and-play commissioning with iGo easy. By the way: iGo easy permits both stand-alone operation and connection to a WMS. And as your automated fleet grows or you want to automate more processes, the scalable software grows with you. It’s that simple.</p>',

Thanks to Active Load Stabilisation (ALS) you can deal with the next goods transport while others would still be waiting for the mast to stop vibrating. An automatic equalising pulse provides a fast and effective way of stopping the vibrations that occur at great heights, reducing the waiting time at the shelf by up to 80 per cent. The result is a significant increase in the rate of turnover. Furthermore, with the FM-X the available storage space can be used more efficiently than ever before; the high residual load capacity means that the reach truck can lift loads of up to 1,000 kg to an incredible height of 13 metres. Relaxed, comfortable and safe work throughout the whole shift is guaranteed by the holistic ergonomics concept. Footplate, steering wheel, seat – all these components can be individually adjusted to match the work requirement at hand as well as the stature and preferences of the driver.<br><br>The FM‐X is a compact and efficient energy bundle convincing with top availability thanks to Li-Ion technology. This does not only allow opportunity charging at any time – it is also fast: 50 % of the battery is chargeable in only 30 minutes. Many other details, such as the optional tilting seat and the exclusive STILL mast side shift, for example, make the FM-X an ideal organiser in any warehouse – from operating high racks to long distance haul or replenishment.<br>',
